# (WIP) A Gamepad App for iOS

## What is this?
This is a work-in-progress sideloaded iOS app that allows you to use your iDevice as a gamepad/controller on a computer. 

## Why was this created?
Real, physical controllers are expensive, coming in at a hefty $70. This free and open-source app was created to allow you to use your phone as a controller for free. 
It is also my Passion Project for my core class.
